//when the player first presses a key we can activate two different variables along with the key they pushed, first one will be randomized to determine what pattern of shooting we will use
//second variable will be used to determine when the pattern can be reset for example we could have both variables set to 1.0 and true, the if statement takes in the true value and proceeds to randomize the 1.0 variable
//which ever pattern is called, that pattern will set the true to false. Once the pattern is finished such as the bullets leaving the game field we can set the value back to true in order to get a new value
